💱 Currency Converter Web Application

This is a simple Currency Converter web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The app allows users to convert one currency into another using real-time exchange rates and displays the converted amount instantly.

I built this project to strengthen my frontend development fundamentals and to gain hands-on experience with API integration, DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript logic.

For the design and overall layout, I took guidance from a YouTube tutorial.
The purpose of following the tutorial was to understand the workflow and structure, so that I can confidently build similar projects on my own in the future.
